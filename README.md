## userChrome.css Theme
This is a userChrome.css theme. 

## Installation

Important: Custom CSS is disabled by default. You will need to enable it in the "Config Editor" inside Preferences. The flag is called 'toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets', search for it and double tap on it to enable to true.

When you use Custom CSS feature in Thunderbird, it overrides any other features that other themes may have setup. Disable other themese before installing this one to seek the expected results.

Locate your profile folder and copy userChrome.css under 'chrome' directory:

* On Windows Vista/XP/2000, the path is usually %AppData%\Thunderbird\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default\, where xxxxxxxx is a random string of 8 characters. Just browse to C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\ on Windows XP/2000 or C:\users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\ on Windows Vista, and the rest should be obvious.
* On Windows 95/98/Me, the path is usually C:\WINDOWS\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default\
* On Linux, the path is usually ~/.thunderbird/xxxxxxxx.default/
* On Mac OS X, the path is usually ~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/xxxxxxxx.default/
