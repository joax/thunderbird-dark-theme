## Another version: [Monterail Full Dark](https://github.com/conema/monterail-fulldark)

## Thunderbird v68

## What is this?
This is a full theme for the Thunderbird e-mail client, inspired by [Monterail](https://monterail.com/blog/2016/the-power-of-email-clients-why-did-we-redesign-thunderbird) mockup and by [spymastermatt](https://github.com/spymastermatt/thunderbird-monterail)'s dark theme. As opposed to the spymastermatt's version, this theme can be **installed easily and quickly with an addon** and it's **compatible with Thunderbird 78**.

## Installation
### Manual - Download XPI
The first step is to [download](https://github.com/joax/releases) the latest release of the theme XPI. On Thunderbird go to Add-ons > Settings > Install Add-on from file. Choose the XPI you just downloaded.

### Theme market (**recommended procedure**)
The theme can be directly downloaded from the [Thunderbird Add-on market](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/monterail-darkness-extended/), the old version can be found by searching "Monterail Dark 2.0 for TB>68" directly in the add-on page of thunderbird or [there](https://addons.thunderbird.net/it/thunderbird/addon/monterail-dark-2-0-for-tb-68/).
